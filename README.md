# Idiosyncratic
**Hello Pals!!** <br>
Do you want to generate **Unique User IDs** for your users? <br>
Then you are in the right place. <br>
This code can give your website user a distinct ID. <br>

You know what **Idiosyncratic** means. <br>
It means **unique**. <br>
This code can generate not millions or billions, but **TRILLIONS** of Unique IDs. <br> <br>

                                                Why is it so unique 
Because we use **time** and **alpha-numeric characters** to create IDs. Using time to create IDs can make them **very very Idiosyncratic**. <br><br>


                                                             
                                                How to use it
First, download the source code file from this repository. <br><br>
Now, include the file in your project. <br><br>
Finally, call the function:
     Idiosyncratic( //Type your Company/Website name, //Use a separator(to separate name and ID) ).  <br> <br>
Rememer the arguments are necessary. If you dont want them, just give them an empty string. <br><br>
                                                 
  Example ID: **Idiosyncratic_2234709N905032nue5UQFC794c** <br><br>
                                                **TADA !!!! You just generated an Idiosyncratic ID.**
